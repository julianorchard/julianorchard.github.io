# VBA Autoreminder

## Useful, fun, and good for learning about code

It's no secret that Visual Basic is popular as a learning programming language! One of VB's main influences, BASIC (or "Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code") was also meant to be easy to use and good for teaching, and you really see that influence in the simplicity of the language. I'm slightly biased in claiming it's good, because it was one of the first languages I learned quite a bit of (prior to VB, I'd only really used a tiny amount of JavaScript to manipulate the DOM).
