# About Me

![it's me](/res/me.jpg)

I'm Julian and I've been working for half a decade as a Marketing Coordinator. My enthusiasm for scripting and design come together in a perfect storm (usually culminating in web design!). I enjoy making simple but refined designs that are accessible for people of all walks of life, hopefully, to enjoy.

This website is mostly going to be used to jot down thoughts about work related things. I want to share knowledge, and I want to make a habit of blogging for *myself*, as a positive routine.

If you want to get in contact with me, my email is [hello@julianorchard.co.uk](mailto:hello@julianorchard.co.uk), or I'm available on [Twitter dot com](https://twitter.com/julianorchardd).
